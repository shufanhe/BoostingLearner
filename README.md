# Stochastic Gradient Boosting Implementation


## Overview

This project implements a custom Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) model for regression tasks. It compares the performance of this implementation with sklearn's `GradientBoostingRegressor` using a public dataset. The goal is to evaluate the performance and robustness of the custom implementation under various random seeds.


## Set up

* Install conda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
* Create and activate environment:
```
conda env create -n boostinglearner -f environment.yaml
conda activate boostinglearner
```

## Executing program

* In the BoostingLearner directory, run the following command. A browser window will open displaying the contents of the directory, choose Boosting.ipynb.
```
jupyter notebook
```
