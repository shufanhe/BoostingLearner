    "Our goal is to find a function $F^*(\\mathbf{x})$ that maps $x$ to $y$ such that loss function $\\Psi(y, F(\\mathbf{x}))$ is minimized over the joint distribution of all $(y, x)$ values\n",

    "where the base learners are usually chosen to be simple functions of $x$ with parameters $a=\\{a_1, a_2, ...\\}$. \n",

    "The expansion coefficients $\\{\\beta_m\\}_0^M$ and the parameters $\\{a_m\\}_0^M$ are jointly fit (/trained/chosen) to the training data in a forward \"stage-wise\" manner. We start with an initial guess $F_0(x)$, and then for stages $m=1,2,...,M$ we find $\\beta_m$, $a_m$ such that the loss between $y$ and $F_m(x)$ is minimized, \n",

    "\n",
    "**Gradient Boosting** approximately solves for $\\beta_m$ and $a_m$ with a two step procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the base learner is fit by least squares \n",
    "    $$a_m = \\arg \\min_{a,p} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}[\\~y_{im}-ph(x_i;a)]^2$$\n",
    "to the current \"pseudo\"-residuals (i.e. negative gradient of the loss w.r.t true $y_i$ and current predicted value $F_{m-1}(x_i)$)\n",
    "    $$\\~y_{im} = - [\\frac{\\partial \\Psi(y_i, F(x_i))}{\\partial F(x_i)}]_{F(x)=F_{m-1}(x)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, given the base learner $h(x;a_m)$, the optimal value of the coefficient $\\beta_m$ is determined (i.e. by choosing it such that minimizes the \"total\" loss w.r.t the true $y$ and new predicted value $F_m(x)$)\n",
    "    $$\\beta_m = \\arg \\min_\\beta \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\Psi(y_i, F_{m-1}(x_i)+\\beta h(x_i;a_m))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient Tree Boosting** specializes this approach to the case where the base learner $h(x;a)$ is an L-terminal node regression tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each iteration $m$, (*first step*) a regression tree is fitted to the current pseudo-residuals using a top-down \"best-first\" manner with a least-squares splitting criterion. It will partition the $x$-space into L-disjoint regions $\\{R_{lm}\\}_{l=1}^L$ and predicts a separate constant value in each one (region)\n",
    "    $$h(x; \\{R_{lm}\\}_1^L) = \\sum_{l=1}^L \\bar y_{lm} \\mathbb{1}_{x \\in R_{lm}}$$\n",
    "Here the constant value $\\bar y = {mean}_{x_i \\in R_{lm}} (\\~y_{im})$ is the mean of pseudo-residuals in each region $R_{lm}$.\n",
    "The parameters ($a_m$) of this base learner are the splitting variables and corresponding split points defining the tree, which in turn define the corresponding regions $\\{R_{lm}\\}_1^L$ of the partition at the $m \\text{th}$ iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then (*second step*), with the regression tree defined (with $\\{R_{lm}\\}_1^L$ defined), the coefficient $\\beta_m$ can be solved separately within each region $R_{lm}$. Because the tree predicts a constant value within each region, the solution to $\\beta_m$ reduces to a simple \"location\" estimate based on the criterion of the loss function\n",
    "    $$\\gamma_{lm} = \\arg \\min_\\gamma \\sum_{x_i \\in R_{lm}} \\Psi (y_i, F_{m-1}(x_i)+\\gamma)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The current approximation is then separately updated in each corresponding region\n",
    "    $$F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + lr \\cdot \\gamma_{lm} \\mathbb{1}_{x \\in R_{lm}}$$\n",
    "where $lr$ is the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stochastic Gradient Boosting** draws a subsample of the training data at random (without replacement). This randomly selected subsample is then used to fit the base learner ($a_m$) and compute the model update for the current iteration ($\\beta_m$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, let $\\{y_i, x_i\\}_1^N$ be the entire training data sample and $\\{\\pi(i)\\}_1^N$ be a random permutation of the integers $\\{1,...,N\\}$. Then, a random subsample of size $\\~N < N$ is given by $\\{y_{\\pi(i)}, x_{\\pi(i)}\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Implementation** takes the loss function of squared error and used stochastic gradient tree boosting for regression. By injecting the randomness of subsampling into the function estimation procedures, it would ideally be less prune to overfitting and more robust. By gradient boosting, it directly fits each base learner to the residual to the negative gradient of the loss thus converges faster and is more efficient. Nevertheless, it still suffers from the following disadvantages more or less -- 1. still potential overfitting, 2. higher computation cost dues to sequential training, 3. harder interpretability due to complex structures of trees invovled with stochastic subsampling.\n"
